Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 9:38 PM
Yeah, definitely
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 9:38 PM
Do you want me to teach you?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 9:38 PM
uh

ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 9:39 PM
Hold on

And Uroxus took away my rank because he doesn't like me lmao
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 9:41 PM

ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 9:42 PM

When people tell me i don't care anymore :joy:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:05 PM
Do you know how to use studio?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:05 PM
for the most part but i'm no pro
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:06 PM
god damn
You know the properties though, right/
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:10 PM
yea, for the most part.
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:10 PM
Welpp
Lets start now
Because I'm bored
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:10 PM
lol, alright
:pray: master
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:11 PM
Usually I'd take a different aproach on teaching people, but eh
fuck it
I've only taught one person how to script
And they hate me now
:ok_hand:
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:11 PM
:ok_hand:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:12 PM
Alright
I'm going to see how well you know your properties
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:12 PM
,_,
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
Ill say a property, you tell me what it does
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
aight
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
Anchor
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
will not move through normal means
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
BrickColor
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
the color of the current brick
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:13 PM
CanCollide
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
if enabled the player or any other block cannot pass through it
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
Eh
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
:eyes:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:14 PM
poor choice of words but yeah]
Color
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:16 PM
custom color of the current brick
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:16 PM
Yeah
It's a color3 value
Remember that :wink:
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
alright, master
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
Locked
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
didnt remember until reading the tool tip :eyes:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
Lmao
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:17 PM
cannot be affected by in-game tools?
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
I'm going by the wiki(edited)
Do you know what in-game tools are?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
the tools in your hotbar
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:18 PM
yeah, lmao
"If true, the object will not be be selectable by Studio tools or by in-game build tools provided the tools respect this property."(edited)
ClassName
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:19 PM
the literal name of the current brick
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:19 PM
Eh
Yeah
Alright, lets try some harder ones
CFrame
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:20 PM
:x:(edited)
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Lmao
That's alright
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:21 PM
the position, rotation and scale of an object, right?
>.>
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Uhh
Not scale
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:22 PM
alright
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:22 PM
But Position and Rotation :thumbsup:
Fun Fact: There are nine rotation values in a CFrame
;)
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:22 PM
:confused:
good to know
kek
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:23 PM
No one actually uses all nine values manually though
Alright
Do you wanna do a real lesson now?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
if you think i'm ready :smile:(edited)
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
the part properties have nothing to do with scripting :joy:
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
:eyes:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:24 PM
It's just the right thing to do before you start scripting
I dunno why, but you always know the properties before you start scripting
Not a lot of entities have all the BasePart properties lmao(edited)
Alright, real lesson
Do you have studio open?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
yeah
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
Do you have the output on?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
yes
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
Command bar?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:26 PM
yes
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:27 PM
Alright
In the Command Bar, type print(), then anything in those parenthesis
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:28 PM
:eyes: if you say so, master
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:28 PM
Then press enter and tell me what shows up in the Output
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:29 PM
"sup"
> print("sup")
sup
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:29 PM
ooo you know about strings
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:29 PM
barely
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:30 PM
Alright, type print(workspace.FilteringEnabled)
Tell me what it says
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:30 PM
false
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:31 PM
Now type, print(workspace.Baseplate.Position). Tell me what it says
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:31 PM
0, -10, 0
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:32 PM
So as of now, you have 'Sup', true, (0, -10, 0)
What do those have in common?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:33 PM
they were all executed by the print command
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:33 PM
Yeah
But there's something else that's more important
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:33 PM
they're strings
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:34 PM
oooo
You're wrong
but on the right track
They all have a Type
In Roblox you only have to worry about a few
You printed three different types
A string, boolean and a Vector3(edited)
Now do print(5) and tell me what it says
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:36 PM
5
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:37 PM
What type do you think that is?(edited)
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:37 PM
int
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
Welp
Did you look it up?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
no
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
oo nice
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
well
yes and no
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
Lmao
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:38 PM
I looked it up before but I didnt look it up now :eyes:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:39 PM
Nice
Alright
So now, we're going to go in a script
Do you know what a variable is?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:39 PM
alright
a key word you attach a value to
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:40 PM
Yeah
Can you show me an example?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:40 PM
no = "u"
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:41 PM
Yeah
Now, I want you to try and print a variable(edited)
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:41 PM
print(no)
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:41 PM
And that would print what?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:41 PM
u
or i guess it would look more like this
no = "u"

print(no)
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:42 PM
Yeah
Im guessing I can skip basic math
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:43 PM
:eyes:
no, teach me 1st grade all over again
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:43 PM
Lmaoo
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:43 PM
:joy:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:43 PM
Just in case you didn't know,
1/1 is division. 1 divided by 1
1*1 Multiplication(edited)
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:44 PM
alright
that's usually how it is in algebra :eyes:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:45 PM
Yeah
Alright
Time to get into the juicy stuff
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:46 PM
:eyes:
alright
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:46 PM
But first, vocab
Do you know what Syntax is?
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:46 PM
uh
<>?
not really
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:50 PM
Nope
Not HTML
:joy:
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:50 PM
srry :joy:
ViciousSilence - Yesterday at 10:51 PM
It's what code looks like
Corgi_Demon - Yesterday at 10:52 PM
alright
